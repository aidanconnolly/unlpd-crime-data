    "# UNLPD Crime Analysis\n",
    "The goal of this project was to analyze University of Nebraska-Lincoln Police Department crime data to identify when crime reports are abnormally high or low. To do so, I collected 13 years of data from UNLPD, taken from the [Daily Crime and Fire Log](https://scsapps.unl.edu/policereports/MainPage.aspx). This program cleans up that data and calculates the average number of occurrences for each crime in a normal month.  \n",
    "Then, it gets the data for this month. If this month's counts are abnormally high or low, a message is created, which is sent to a Slack channel to notify those who are interested."
